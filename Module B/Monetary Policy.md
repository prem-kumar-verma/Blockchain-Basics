# Bitcoin's Monetary Policy  

## Introduction  
Bitcoin is different from traditional money because it follows a **fixed monetary policy** that cannot be changed by any government or central bank.  

## Key Rules of Bitcoin’s Monetary Policy  
1. **Fixed Supply**: There will only ever be **21 million Bitcoins**. No new ones can be printed.  
2. **Mining Rewards**: New Bitcoins are created as rewards for miners, but these rewards **decrease over time**.  
3. **Halving**: Every **four years**, the number of Bitcoins miners receive is cut in half. This controls inflation.  

## Why This Matters  
- Prevents inflation (unlike traditional money, which governments print at will).  
- Encourages scarcity, increasing Bitcoin’s value over time.  
- Ensures a predictable supply of new Bitcoins.  

## Fun Fact  
The last Bitcoin will be mined around **2140**!
