# Bitcoin  

## Introduction  
Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency that allows people to send and receive money over the internet without a bank. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the name **Satoshi Nakamoto**.  

## How Bitcoin Works  
1. You store Bitcoin in a **digital wallet** (like a mobile app or computer program).  
2. When you send Bitcoin, the transaction is **broadcast to a network** of computers (nodes).  
3. Miners verify the transaction and add it to a public ledger called the **blockchain**.  
4. Once confirmed, the Bitcoin is transferred to the recipient.  

## Why Bitcoin is Special  
- **Decentralized**: No single company or government controls it.  
- **Limited Supply**: Only **21 million** Bitcoins will ever exist.  
- **Fast & Global**: Can be sent anywhere without middlemen.  

## Uses of Bitcoin  
- Online payments  
- Investment (like digital gold)  
- Remittances (sending money across countries with low fees)
