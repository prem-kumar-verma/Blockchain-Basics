# Mempool  

## Introduction  
A **mempool (memory pool)** is like a waiting room where Bitcoin transactions stay before they are confirmed by miners.  

## How It Works  
1. You send a Bitcoin transaction.  
2. It goes to the **mempool** of Bitcoin nodes.  
3. Miners pick transactions with **higher fees** first.  
4. Once mined, the transaction is removed from the mempool.  

## Why the Mempool Matters  
- If too many transactions are waiting, network congestion occurs.  
- Higher fees get **faster confirmations**.  
- During peak times, mempool can get full, delaying transactions.
