# CPU, GPU, and ASIC Mining  

## Introduction  
Mining can be done using different types of hardware:  

### **1. CPU (Central Processing Unit) Mining**  
- Uses a regular computer processor.  
- Very slow and inefficient today.  
- Was used in Bitcoinâ€™s early days (2009-2010).  

### **2. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) Mining**  
- Uses graphics cards (like those in gaming PCs).  
- Faster than CPUs, but still less efficient for Bitcoin mining today.  

### **3. ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) Mining**  
- Custom-built chips designed ONLY for Bitcoin mining.  
- Thousands of times faster than GPUs and CPUs.  
- Used by professional miners in **mining farms**.  

## Which One is Best?  
- **For Bitcoin:** ASIC miners are required.  
- **For Other Cryptos (like Ethereum):** GPUs are still useful.
