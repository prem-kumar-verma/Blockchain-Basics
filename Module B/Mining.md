# Mining  

## Introduction  
Bitcoin mining is like a lottery where computers compete to solve math puzzles. The winner gets **new Bitcoins** and confirms transactions on the network.  

## How Mining Works  
1. Miners collect new Bitcoin transactions.  
2. They race to solve a cryptographic puzzle.  
3. The first miner to solve it **adds a block** to the blockchain.  
4. The miner receives a **Bitcoin reward** and transaction fees.  

## Why Mining is Important  
- Keeps the network secure.  
- Verifies transactions without needing a central authority.  
- Controls the supply of new Bitcoins.  

## Downsides of Mining  
- Requires **a lot of electricity**.  
- Becomes harder as more miners join.  
- Specialized hardware (ASICs) is needed to compete.
