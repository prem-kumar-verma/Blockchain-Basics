# Public and Private Keys  

## Introduction  
Bitcoin security is based on **cryptographic keys** that help keep transactions safe and secure.  

## Public Key  
- Like an **email address**: You can share it with anyone.  
- Used to receive Bitcoin.  

## Private Key  
- Like a **password**: Must be kept secret.  
- Controls access to your Bitcoin.  

## How They Work Together  
- When you send Bitcoin, your **private key signs** the transaction.  
- The network verifies your **public key** to confirm it's from you.  

## Important!  
- Losing your private key = Losing your Bitcoin!  
- Always store it safely (hardware wallet, secure backups).
