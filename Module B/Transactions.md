# Bitcoin Transactions  

## Introduction  
A Bitcoin transaction is a digital transfer of Bitcoin from one person to another over the blockchain network.  

## How a Transaction Works  
1. A sender enters the **recipient's wallet address**.  
2. The sender chooses how much Bitcoin to send.  
3. The transaction is **broadcast to the network**.  
4. Miners verify and confirm the transaction.  
5. Once confirmed, the Bitcoin appears in the recipientâ€™s wallet.  

## Key Parts of a Bitcoin Transaction  
- **Sender Address**: Where the Bitcoin is coming from.  
- **Recipient Address**: Where the Bitcoin is going.  
- **Transaction Fee**: Extra Bitcoin paid to miners to prioritize processing.  
- **Transaction ID**: A unique ID that helps track the payment.
