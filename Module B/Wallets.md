# Bitcoin Wallets  

## Introduction  
A Bitcoin wallet is like a **digital bank account** that lets you send, receive, and store Bitcoin.  

## Types of Wallets  
1. **Hot Wallets (Online)**  
   - Connected to the internet.  
   - Easy to use but **less secure**.  
   - Examples: Mobile apps, browser wallets.  

2. **Cold Wallets (Offline)**  
   - Not connected to the internet.  
   - Very secure but less convenient.  
   - Examples: Hardware wallets, paper wallets.  

## Why Wallets Matter  
- Without a wallet, you can't store or use Bitcoin.  
- **Private keys** inside wallets **control your Bitcoin ownership**.
