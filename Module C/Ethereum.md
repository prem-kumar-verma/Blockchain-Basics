# What is Ethereum?

## Introduction  
Ethereum is a **decentralized blockchain platform** that allows developers to create applications using **smart contracts**. It was founded in **2015 by Vitalik Buterin** to go beyond Bitcoinâ€™s financial transactions and enable programmable blockchain applications.

## Key Features of Ethereum  
1. **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with rules written in code.  
2. **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**: Apps that run on Ethereum without a central authority.  
3. **Ether (ETH)**: The native cryptocurrency used for transactions and fees.  
4. **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**: A global computer that runs Ethereum applications.  
5. **Gas Fees**: Transaction costs paid in ETH to use the Ethereum network.  

## How Ethereum Differs from Bitcoin  
| Feature      | Bitcoin                          | Ethereum                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Purpose     | Digital currency (store of value) | Smart contracts & DApps       |
| Supply      | Fixed at 21 million BTC          | No fixed limit on ETH         |
| Block Time | ~10 min | ~12-15 sec |
| Speed       | Slower transactions              | Faster transactions           |
| Flexibility | Limited scripting                | Fully programmable            |
| Mining | Proof of Work (PoW) | Moving to Proof of Stake (PoS) |

## Why Ethereum is Important  
- Enables decentralized finance (**DeFi**) applications.  
- Powers **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**.  
- Supports **Web3 development** for the future of the internet.
