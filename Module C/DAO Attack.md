# DAO Attack

## What Happened?  
In **2016**, The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) was hacked due to a **smart contract vulnerability**.

## How the Attack Worked  
1. A hacker found a bug in the DAOâ€™s code.  
2. They repeatedly withdrew ETH without updating the balance.  
3. They drained **$60 million worth of ETH** from the DAO.  

## Solution: Ethereum Hard Fork  
- The Ethereum community **created a new blockchain (Ethereum)** to reverse the attack.  
- The old blockchain continued as **Ethereum Classic (ETC)**.  

## Lesson Learned  
- Even smart contracts can have **bugs**.  
- Always audit smart contracts before deploying them.
