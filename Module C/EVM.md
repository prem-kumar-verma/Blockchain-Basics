# EVM and Gas

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)  
The **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** is a global computer that executes smart contracts. Every node in the Ethereum network runs the EVM to process transactions.

## Why EVM is Important  
- Ensures all Ethereum nodes follow the same rules.  
- Allows developers to create decentralized applications (DApps).  
- Protects against fraud by making transactions irreversible.  

## What is Gas?  
Gas is the **fee paid in ETH** to execute transactions and smart contracts on Ethereum.

## How Gas Works  
1. Every action on Ethereum (sending ETH, using a DApp) requires computation.  
2. Gas is used to pay for this computation.  
3. More complex transactions **cost more gas**.  
4. Gas prices fluctuate based on network demand.  

## Example  
- **Simple transaction** (sending ETH) = Low gas fee.  
- **Complex smart contract** (NFT minting) = High gas fee.  

## Why Gas is Necessary  
- Prevents spam and overuse of the network.  
- Rewards miners and validators for securing the network.  
- Ensures fair use of computational power.
