# DApps (Decentralized Applications)

## Introduction  
DApps (Decentralized Applications) are applications built on a blockchain that run **without a central authority**.  

## Features of DApps  
- **Decentralized**: No single company controls them.  
- **Open-source**: The code is transparent and can be verified.  
- **Blockchain-Based**: Uses Ethereum or other blockchains for security.  
- **Tokenized Economy**: Many DApps have their own tokens.  

## Examples of DApps  
- **Uniswap**: A decentralized exchange for trading cryptocurrencies.  
- **OpenSea**: A marketplace for NFTs (digital collectibles).  
- **Aave**: A lending and borrowing DeFi platform.  
- **Axie Infinity**: A blockchain-based game.  

## Why DApps Matter  
- **No censorship**: Unlike traditional apps, no one can shut them down.  
- **More secure**: Data is stored on the blockchain, making it tamper-proof.  
- **User-owned**: Users control their own assets and identities.
