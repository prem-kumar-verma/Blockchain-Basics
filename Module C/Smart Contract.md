# Smart Contracts

## Introduction  
A **smart contract** is a self-executing contract where the terms are written directly in code. Once deployed, it runs **automatically** without intermediaries.

## How Smart Contracts Work  
1. A contract is created with specific rules (e.g., "send 1 ETH if task is completed").  
2. The contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.  
3. When the conditions are met, the contract **executes itself**.  
4. No one can change or tamper with the contract once deployed.  

## Example  
Imagine a **vending machine**:  
- You insert money.  
- The machine checks if the amount is correct.  
- If correct, it releases the product.  
- If not, the machine does nothing.  

Smart contracts work similarly, but they handle digital agreements automatically!

## Uses of Smart Contracts  
- **Finance**: Automated loans and payments.  
- **Gaming**: NFTs and in-game rewards.  
- **Supply Chain**: Track goods transparently.  
- **Legal Agreements**: Digital contracts without middlemen.
