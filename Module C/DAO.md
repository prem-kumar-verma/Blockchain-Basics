# DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)

## Introduction  
A **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** is a blockchain-based organization that runs on smart contracts without a central authority.

## How DAOs Work  
1. Members hold **tokens** that represent voting power.  
2. Decisions (funding, governance) are made through **voting**.  
3. Smart contracts automatically execute the agreed actions.  

## Examples of DAOs  
- **MakerDAO**: Manages the DAI stablecoin.  
- **The DAO (2016)**: One of the first DAOs, later hacked.  
- **ConstitutionDAO**: Raised money to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution.  

## Benefits of DAOs  
- **Transparent**: Rules and transactions are on the blockchain.  
- **Democratic**: Decisions are made by token holders.  
- **Automated**: Smart contracts remove the need for middlemen.
