# Consensus Protocol

## Introduction
A consensus protocol ensures agreement among network participants regarding the state of the blockchain.

## Importance of Consensus
- **Prevents Double Spending**: Ensures a transaction isn’t recorded twice.
- **Maintains Decentralization**: No single entity has control.
- **Enhances Security**: Protects against malicious attacks.

## Types of Consensus Mechanisms
### 1. Proof of Work (PoW)
- Used in Bitcoin.
- Miners solve puzzles to validate transactions.
- Requires high computational power.

### 2. Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Used in Ethereum 2.0.
- Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold.
- More energy-efficient than PoW.

### 3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Participants vote for delegates to validate transactions.
- Used in networks like EOS.

### 4. Proof of Authority (PoA)
- Transactions are validated by pre-approved nodes.
- Common in private blockchains.

## Conclusion
The choice of a consensus mechanism depends on the blockchain's goal—whether it's security, scalability, or energy efficiency.
