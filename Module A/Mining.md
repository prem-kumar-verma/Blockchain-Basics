# What is Mining?

## Introduction
Mining is the process of validating and adding new transactions to the blockchain by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.

## How Mining Works
1. Miners collect pending transactions.
2. They solve a mathematical puzzle (Proof of Work).
3. The first miner to solve it gets to add a new block to the blockchain.
4. The miner is rewarded with cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin).

## Mining Components
- **Nonce**: A random number used to find a valid hash.
- **Difficulty**: Adjusts the complexity of mining.
- **Rewards**: Miners receive new coins and transaction fees.

## Types of Mining
- **CPU Mining**: Uses computer processors.
- **GPU Mining**: Uses graphics cards for better efficiency.
- **ASIC Mining**: Uses specialized hardware for high performance.
