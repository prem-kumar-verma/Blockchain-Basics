# What is Blockchain?

## Introduction
Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner.

## Key Characteristics
- **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the blockchain.
- **Transparency**: All participants can verify transactions.
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be altered.

## How It Works
1. Transactions are created and broadcasted to the network.
2. Network nodes validate the transaction.
3. Transactions are grouped into a block.
4. Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous block.
5. The block is added to the blockchain, making the transaction final.

## Real-World Applications
- Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Supply Chain Management
- Digital Identity
