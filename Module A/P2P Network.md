# Distributed P2P Networks

## Introduction
A **peer-to-peer (P2P) network** is a decentralized communication system where all participants (nodes) share and validate transactions.

## Key Features
- **No Central Authority**: Every node has equal rights.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Network remains operational even if some nodes fail.
- **Censorship Resistance**: No entity can control transactions.

## How It Works
1. A user initiates a transaction.
2. The transaction is broadcasted to all network nodes.
3. Nodes validate the transaction using consensus.
4. Once verified, the transaction is added to the blockchain.

## Examples of P2P Networks
- Bitcoin
- BitTorrent
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
