# Immutable Ledger

## Introduction

An immutable ledger ensures that once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.

## Why is Immutability Important?
- **Prevents Fraud**: No one can manipulate transaction history.
- **Enhances Trust**: Ensures data integrity and authenticity.
- **Increases Security**: Protects against malicious attacks.

## How Immutability is Achieved
1. **Cryptographic Hashing**: Every block contains a hash of the previous block.
2. **Consensus Mechanisms**: Transactions require network validation.
3. **Decentralization**: No central authority can alter data.

## Real-World Applications
- Financial transactions
- Legal contracts
- Medical records
